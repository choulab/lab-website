### Postdocs

Prospective postdoctoral scholars should send Leo an email and discuss your research interests ( include your CV and contact details of three references). It would be great if you can suggest potential topics you are interested in working on. You're certainly not bound by this, it is merely a starting point of conversation.<br><br>

### Graduate students

We are always looking for highly motivated students with a passion for engineering biology and developing new biomedical technologies to join our mission-driven and dynamic work environment. Prospective students should send Leo an email to introduce yourself, what your interests are, along with your up-to-date CV and transcript.<br><br>

### Undergraduate students

We offer a limited number of fully-funded summer internship positions each year. Our lab can also sponsor undergraduate design competitions and thesis projects. Interested individuals are advised to email Leo early in the year to introduce yourself, your interests, along with your CV and transcript.
