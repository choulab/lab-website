title: Personalized nano-vaccines

summary: <font color="navy">_Therapeutic design_</font><br>Neoantigen vaccine is a personalized approach to treat cancer that harnesses the power of mobilizing our immune system. However, there are formidable logistical and manufacturing challenges to personalizing treatments in a cost-effective and timely manner. Regardless, these considerations are paramount to providing clinical benefits. Leveraging the programmability of DNA nanostructures, we aim to develop universal nanoparticle chassis for rapid formulation of neoantigen vaccines. By establishing a plug-and-play platform, we hope to facilitate the adoption and effectiveness of neoantigen vaccines towards front-line clinical use.<br>
