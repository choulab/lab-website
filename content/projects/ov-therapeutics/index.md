title: Immune-therapeutics and personalized vaccines

summary: In defense of a vast border, our immune system has evolved intricate mechanisms to recognize pathogenic microbes such as viruses and bacteria. Using a range of techniques - DNA nanotechnology, molecular engineering, materials chemistry - we can engineer biosynthetic nanotechnologies that recapitulate the signals presented by these pathogens. We are using this capability to develop therapeutic strategies that direct powerful immune responses against complex diseases such as cancer.<br> **[Learn more](/research#therapeutics)**
