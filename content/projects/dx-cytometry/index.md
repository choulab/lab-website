title: DNA-barcoded cytometry<br>
subtitle: 
summary: <font color="navy">_Assay development_</font><br>Different cell types and states determine their functions. The ability to classify and sort cell-types and states rapidly and at-scale is increasingly critical for the study of multi-cellular biology and cell therapy manufacturing. While existing cytometry methods are quite powerful, they bear specific limitations. We are developing approaches based on DNA-barocded recognition to innovate new modes of cytometry for demand-meeting applications.<br><br>
