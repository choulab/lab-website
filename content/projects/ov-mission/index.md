title: Overview - Programmable molecular systems

summary: Our mission is to enable precision and personalized approaches to medicine via the development of molecular and nanoscale technologies that are amenable to rational design (i.e. programmable). Our current efforts largely focus on engineering immune-based therapies to treat cancer and cellular diagnostics. We are an interdisciplinary research laboratory working at the intersection of nanotechnology, molecular engineering, immunology, and computational biology.
