title: Massively parallel assays<br>
subtitle: 
summary: <font color="navy">_Device design_</font><br>Recent pandemic outbreaks, such as COVID, have highlighted important limitations in existing surveillance and point-of-care diagnostic technologies. One, globaly circulating pathogens often go undetected until it is too late, and two, there currently lacks inexpensive and easy-to-use solutions for detecting all of these pathogens against hundreds to thousands of individual samples simultaenously. To combat these two challenges, here we are innovating new solutions that can enable massively parallel such assays with clinically meaningful sensitivity.<br><br>
