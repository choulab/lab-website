title: Programmable self-assembling nanostructures
summary: <font color="navy">_Formulation engineering_</font><br>Nanoparticles have several promising features as drug delivery systems, but their in vivo design principles are just beginning to be understood. For example, the majority of existing formulations rapidly end up in the liver following in vivo administration, making them ill-suited for treating many diseases. Using nanoscopic structures made of DNA, which can be programmed with arbitrary user-prescribed shapes and dynamics, we are elucidating how nanoparticle features determine their cell-type specific uptake and subcellular localization patterns for guiding the design of more efficient nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems.<br>
