title: Designing probes for molecular imaging<br>
subtitle: 
summary: <font color="navy">_Probe discovery_</font><br>Advances in genomics and the declining cost of sequencing have made it feasible to detect pathogens and diseases by sequencing the RNA or DNA in heterogeneous biological samples. However, a common challenge is to find the rare, trace amounts of tell-tale molecules in an overwhelming amount of background signals. To overcome this challenge, we are developing probes that are brighter and binds targets more specifically by combining computational design, DNA nanotechnology, and synthetic biology. These probes will enable the detection of biomolecules with greater sensitivity and specificity. We work with biologists and clinicians to validate probe performance under different modalities.<br>
