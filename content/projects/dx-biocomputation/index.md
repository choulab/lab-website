title: Molecular computers for the point-of-care

summary: <font color="navy">_Assay development_</font><br>Complex diseases are often associated with changes in the expression levels of many genes. These changes are currently only detectable in centralized labs by trained experts using sophisticated instruments. To make medicine more equitable, we are developing "biomolecular computers" to diagnose diseases with minimal instrumentation and user-intervention. In contrast to silicon computers, biocomputers will be much smaller, lighter, and will be able to operate directly on patient derived analytes (e.g. DNA, RNA or proteins) without the need for an external power supply. We envision these capabilities to expand the range of diseases that can be diagnosed at the point-of-care.
