title: Molecular and single-cell technologies
summary: Much of what happens inside the body is hidden to us, but are collectively encoded by incredible cell-type diversity and cell-cell interaction networks. We combine seemingly distant fields - DNA nanotechnology, machine learning, imaging, and microfabrication - to develop assays with unprecedented abilities to unravel this complexity of biological systems, dissect cell phenotypes, and diagnose diseases. <br>**[Learn more](/research#analytics)**
