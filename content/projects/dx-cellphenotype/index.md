summary: <font color="navy">_Single-cell profiling_</font><br>Cell-type diversity and cell-cell interactions underlie the formation of multicellular tissues and diseases such as cancer. These interactions involve both soluble signaling and physical contacts between cells, and together constitute â€˜signaling programs' that determine cellular behaviors. Deciphering the nature of this circuit is the first and foremost challenge towards precision and personalized medicine. We are developing technologies to perform precise, multiplexed, and spatially resolved single cell analyses. Ultimately, this will allow better understanding of cells and engineered cell therapies.
