Meghan is a PhD candidate at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Toronto. Her research interests include DNA nanotechnology, cancer immunotherapies, and molecular engineering.<br><br>

Prior to becoming a member of Dr. Chou’s lab at BME, Meghan completed her undergraduate degree in Health Sciences with a specialization in Biomedical Discovery and Commercialization at McMaster University. She completed her undergraduate thesis under the supervision of Dr. Todd Hoare working on synthesizing and characterizing POLAMA-b-POEGMA copolymers for nanoparticle based drug delivery for cancer therapy applications. Meghan also completed her Masters in Biochemistry at McMaster under the supervision of Dr. Yingfu Li where she worked on developing a DNAzyme-based biosensor for Legionella pneumophila detection. During her time at McMaster, Meghan competed as a varsity athlete for the Marauders cross country and track team.<br><br>

Outside of the lab Meghan loves to run and workout, indulge her sweet tooth, and hangout with friends.
