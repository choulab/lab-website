Leo Chou is an assistant professor in the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering at University of Toronto, and one of the investigators at Medicine by Design, a Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFREF)-supported initiative. His research interests include DNA nanotechnology, molecular engineering, and synthetic biology. His lab is developing artificial, self-assembling molecular devices for biomedical applications, including for biomarker discovery, diagnostics, and therapeutics.

Before joining the IBBME faculty in Jan 2019, Leo was a Banting Fellow at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and at the Wyss Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. He completed his PhD training with Dr. Warren Chan at the University of Toronto.
