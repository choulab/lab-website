Amir is a Direct-Entry PhD student at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Toronto. His current research interests are DNA nanotechnology, cancer immunotherapies, and molecular engineering.

Prior to becoming a member of Dr.Chouâ€™s lab in BME, Amir completed his undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. There, under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Passandideh-Fard, he designed a microfluidic device and convolutional neural networks to investigate and predict human spermatozoa migration under physiological conditions. Before that, he designed and patented a novel industrial equipment cooling method using nanoparticles at the same lab. During his time at FUM, Amir also started his own startup which he later sold to the biggest Iranian food delivery company.

Outside of the lab, Amir loves driving, exploring his new city, discovering new cafes and restaurants, reading, and enjoying classical music.
