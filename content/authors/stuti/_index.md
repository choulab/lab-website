Stuti is a Masters candidate at the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Toronto. Her research interests include molecular biology, cellular signalling, and nanoengineering. 

Before joining her cohort at IBBME, Stuti completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto Mississauga, where she specialized in Molecular Biology and majored in Health Sciences. Her undergraduate thesis investigated the role of myoinhibiting peptides on physiological functions of the kissing bug, *Rhodnius prolixus*.

When Stuti isn't tackling the big questions at the nano level, she can be found practicing henna designs, reading a cliffhanger, or riding her bike.
