Shana is a Direct-Entry PhD student at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Toronto. Her research interests include DNA nanotechnology, cancer immunotherapies, and molecular engineering.<br><br>

Prior to becoming a member of Dr. Chou’s lab in BME, Shana completed her undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering with a specialization in Biochemical Engineering at Western University. She completed her undergraduate thesis with Dr. Arghya Paul and then continued into a summer research project in the same lab supported by an Engineering Research Award, the Dean's Award.  Here, she developed surface-patterned, biocompatible hydrogels as drug delivery scaffolds for diabetic wound healing. During her time at Western, Shana was also a varsity athlete for the Western Women’s Hockey team, where she earned an OUA Gold Medal and a Silver Medal at the National Championships in 2018.<br><br>

When Shana's not attempting to understand the complexies of our immune system, she loves staying active, reading, and exploring her new city.
