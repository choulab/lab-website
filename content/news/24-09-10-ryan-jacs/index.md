Ryan's work on combining PCR synthesis, solid-phase immobilization, and microfluidics to create DNA computers from reusable building blocks is now [published](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.4c07221) online in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. A big thanks to Prof. Nadanai Laohakunakorn and his lab at University of Edinburgh for help with microfludics. Congratulations Ryan!
