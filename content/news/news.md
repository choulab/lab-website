### May 2020
- The lab just received approval for our NSERC Discovery Grant!

### Apr 2020
- The lab joins the Task Force launched by PRiME to help combat COVID-19. Read about what the task force plans to do [here](https://www.utoronto.ca/news/u-t-precision-medicine-initiative-launches-task-force-fight-covid-19)
- The lab is one of 31 UofT labs to be funded by the Toronto COVID-19 Action Initiative. We will be using this fund to develop better tools for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Read the coverage [here](https://www.utoronto.ca/news/u-t-support-31-high-impact-coronavirus-research-projects-through-toronto-covid-19-action-fund?utm_source=The+Bulletin+Brief&utm_campaign=00a59609d4-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_06_13_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b5083c0488-00a59609d4-110170115)

### Nov 2019
<!--- Our application for a [CFI-JELF](https://www.innovation.ca/awards/john-r-evans-leaders-fund) fund has been approved! This fund will support the purchase of major equipment for our lab. -->
- The lab is now part of UofT's Precision Medicine ([PRiME](https://prime.utoronto.ca)) initiative. Looking forward to being part of the community
- Construction for our new lab space has finally started after >6 months of planning (>1 yr on the admin side). Can't wait for the grand opening next year!

### Oct 2019
- Leo's paper on nucleic-acid programmable in vitro synthetic gene circuits is now published on [ACS Synthetic Biology](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00242)

### Aug 2019
- Stuti is a recipient of this year's Milligan Graduate Scholarship in IBBME, congrats Stuti!
- Welcome Stuti, Travis, Abdulmateen, and Ryan (aka team S.T.A.R.) to the lab!
- The beta version of the lab website is now live!

### May 2019
- The lab has been [awarded](https://startupheretoronto.com/partners/uoft/xseed-catalyzing-multidisciplinary-research-at-u-of-t/) an Xseed grant for collaborative work with the Treanor lab to study B cell response to 3D antigen arrays!
