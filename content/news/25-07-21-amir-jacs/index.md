Amir, Travis, and Shana's work, now [published](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jacs.5c07566) in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, showed that PEG grafted oligolysines can stabilize DNA origami while mediating interactions of surface-displayed ligands with cellular receptors. Congratulations team!
