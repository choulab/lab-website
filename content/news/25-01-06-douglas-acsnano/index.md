Travis and Shana's on synthetic immune complexes is now [published](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.4c11183) online in the journal ACS Nano. They showed that patterned antigens on DNA origami can lead to the formation of immune complexes with distinct (and programmable) structures and cell uptake. Congratulations team!
