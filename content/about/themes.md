The overarching question in our lab is to understand how functionality emerges from nanoscale biomolecular self-organization. Currently, we study this in the context of membrane receptor signaling and its consequences on cell decision-making and fate. To this end, we create molecular technologies that allow us to study and manipulate membrane receptor interactions. Projects in the lab fall into one of three categories:
 
<h3>Molecular Recording</h3>
A major challenge in bio-medicine is to decipher the complex network of biomolecular interactions that give rise to a physiological or disease phenotype. These interactions are complex because they vary spatiotemporally across length scales (e.g., molecules, cells, and tissues), and involve a staggering diversity of biomolecules. We are interested in developing technologies that enable these molecular interactions (as well as their functional consequences!) to be profiled in a sensitive, quantitative, and high-throughput manner. Outcome from this research will help us better understand the molecular "interactome" within cells and tissues, and lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers for the detection and treatment of diseases.

<h3>Molecular Computing</h3>
Cells use self-assembly interactions between biomolecules to sense, compute, and integrate information about their environment. Inspired by this, we are developing DNA and protein-based computers capable of complex computation. Our approach integrates concepts from DNA nanotechnology, synthetic biology, materials chemistry, and device fabrication in an effort to make computation faster, more scalable, and more accurate. Compared to silicon circuits, these molecular computers have the advantage that they can operate in wet environments, they can directly use biomolecules and cells as inputs, and they do not need a power supply to function. We are interested in developing these capabilities for sensing and biomanufacturing applications.

<h3>Molecular Actuation</h3>
Using the principles of synthetic biology and the tools of protein engineering and DNA nantoechnology, we aim to create artificial self-assembling machines that can perturb endogenous cellular machineries. By creating artificial nanostructures with precise shapes and dynamics, we can generate machines that perform mechanical and biochemical tasks for controlling cell fate. Ultimately, we hope our artificial molecular machines will rival the functional complexity of naturally-exiting molecular machines for applications as next-generation therapeutics.
