## Hours & Locations

In general, it is up to you to manage your own time. Nevertheless, just like any other group organizations, we need a schedule so that we can work as a team. A group schedule will help us find each other when we need help or need to ask questions. Here is the current H&L policy:

- **Lab Calendar.** We use a group calendar to schedule lab activities, such as group meetings, socials, lab clean ups, and institutional events. Sync it to your calendar so you can stay updated on group activities. We also use it to note when everyone is absent. Please note your absence on the group calendar so we know you’re away.
- **Group hours.** Everyone is expected to be at his/her office or in the lab from the hours of 10AM to 5PM. This is so that everyone who needs to find you, can do so. If you are away, either put up a note at your desk or on the group calendar.
- **PI open office hours.** Leo has an open-door policy. Feel free to drop in to ask questions at any time if he’s around. If you anticipate long discussions (e.g. 1 hr), please schedule.
