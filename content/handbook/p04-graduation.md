For departmental guidelines, consult the departmental handbook ([PDF](https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/Current_Students/2018-19-Graduate-Handbook.pdf)). Within the lab, the most important criteria is your research output. A general expectation is 1 to 2 publications for a Master’s degree and 3 to 5 publications for a PhD degree in peer-reviewed journals.

Note, these publications have to be original research; review articles do not count.

Moreover, an equally important assessment is your ability to defend your work – its merits and limitations, and directions for the future. This is judged during yearly committee meetings. Your thesis committee will let you know if they think you’re ready to defend your thesis.
The actual thesis document can be a “paper”-based thesis – a collage of your publications, along with an introductory chapter and a future chapter at the end. These two chapters could be written specifically for the thesis, or as part of a review paper. This is why it is important to be productive, as it will make your thesis preparation very straightforward and even enjoyable.<br>

The actual defense will be a 30-minute oral presentation, followed by 1 to 2 hours of Q&A by your committee members. In our lab, we advocate for open defenses, meaning it will be publicly advertised and anyone who wishes to attend your presentation can do so. The follow up Q&A session will be private. Don’t stress this. If you’ve gotten the go-ahead from your committee, we think you’re ready and you will be fine for your actual thesis defense.
