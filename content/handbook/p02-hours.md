In general, it is up to you to manage your own time. Nevertheless, just like any other group organizations, we need a schedule so that we can work as a team. A group schedule will help us find each other when we need help or need to ask questions. Here is the current H&L policy:<br><br>


## Lab calendar

We use a Google Calendar to schedule all lab activities, such as group meetings, socials, lab clean ups, and institutional events. Request access via this [e-mail](lytchoulab@gmail.com). You will be granted view and edit access. **You are expected to note your absence on this calendar so we know you’re away.**<br><br>

## Group hours

Everyone is expected to be at his/her office or in the lab from the hours of **10AM to 5PM**. This is so that everyone who needs to find you, can do so. If you are away, either put up a note at your desk or on the lab calendar.<br><br>

## PI office hours

Leo has an open-door policy. Feel free to drop in to ask questions at any time if he’s around. If you anticipate long discussions (e.g. 1 hr), please schedule.
