## Scheduling

The lab uses a Google Calendar to organize all group activities, such as group meetings, socials, lab clean ups, and institutional events. Send a request to this [email](lytchoulab@gmail.com) to obtain access. This will keep you in the loop on all lab activities. You are also expected to note any time you're away during [group hours](/handbook/hours#grouphours) on this calendar.

## Task management

Use [Trello](https://www.trello.com) to generate to-do lists and plan your schedule. Its free and you can sign-in using a Google Account. You should develop the habit of reviewing your activities on a daily basis. For example, right before you leave the lab, plan out your activities for the next day using Trello. Trello integrates with Google Calendar, so once you have generated your to-do list with due dates, you can use your calendar to know when you need to be doing what. When you have completed items on your to-do list, check the items off as you go along. This will help you prioritize and stay focused. More on using Trello for research [here](/handbook/metadata#todos)

## Remote journal access

You should be able to access journal articles off-campus by setting up virtual private network (VPN) on your computer. To do so, go to [UTORVpn](http://vpn.utoronto.ca/) and choose the right install for your computer (e.g. PC vs. Mac). Once installed, you will be able to access the UofT network via VPN. This should provide you with journal access directly from your browser as if youâ€™re on campus.

## File storage

All materials generated from your project (including protocols, images, numerical data, scripts for analysis, presentation slides, manuscripts, ...etc.) should be kept in a centralized location so they can be accessed by current and future lab members. This location will be equipped with back up and version control. We are temporarily using [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/h) because it is easy to use. Leo will send you the shared link. This location will also contain all common lab files, such as documentation of archived projects, inventory, working manuscript files, etc.

## Inventory management

We use two files to manage our reagents and supplies inventory. The first is a Google Sheet named `Lab Purchasing YYYY`, where `YYYY` is the current year. This tracks all purchasing requests and orders placed for that year. Leo will share access to this file to you along with group calendar access. You use this sheet to request reagents and supplies, check if orders have been placed, and document items that have been depleted from the inventory (see [ordering](/handbook/ordering)). Periodically, this sheet will be used to automatically update an Excel file on our server called a `Master Inventory`. You can peruse `Master Inventory` for all items purchased in previous years.


## Project documentation

We use [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) to document all *conceptual* aspects of a project, which includes the following items:

- **Meeting** notes: this includes both group and project meetings, and informal discussions with colleagues and advisors
- **Reading** notes: annotate papers that you've read and find relevant
- **Clippings**: screenshots, websites, web-based tables, etc.
- **Presentation** notes: this includes notes you take at conference presentations
- **Ideas**: any time you have an idea, for example that stemmed from your research activities, such as follow up projects, new research questions, or ideas on how to solve a bottleneck, write them down so you can articulate them and discuss with Leo or other people later!

You should have **one notebook per project**. You should also create a `tag` for each of the items listed above. Everytime you jot down something, categorize them by tag. This will help you find the note later on (what good is a notebook if you can't ever find anything?). Get into the habit of writing down something every week, or even every day. Share your project notebook with all project members (including Leo!)

> Get into the habit of documenting all of your thoughts on paper! **Remember, the only thing between messing things around and science is writing things down!**


## Experiment documentation

Each experiment you perform should contain these items:

- protocol (written in Microsoft Word or some text editor that supports tables)
- raw results (e.g. images, numerical data)
- scripts (for analyzing the results, if needed)

These items should be stored in one folder with a standardized naming convention: `your initials+experiment number-experiment date-experiment description`. For example, let's say Leo performed his first experiment on January 25th, 2019 on folding DNA origami, then the folder name would be `LC001-190125-origami-folding`. All of your experiments belonging to a project would be stored in that project's `Experiments` sub-folder. This sub-folder can contain experiments performed by you as well as by other researchers participating in the same project. This project folder will therefore live on a sharable, centralized location, such as the group's server. More on this in later section on [organizing your research](/handbook/whatisresearch).
