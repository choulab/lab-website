All of the [above](/handbook/example1), and I also promise to:

- Support you (scientifically, financially, emotionally)
- Give you feedback on a timely basis, including feedback on project ideas, conference posters, talks, manuscripts, figures, grants
- Be available in person and via e-mail on a regular basis, including regular meetings to discuss your research (and anything else you’d like to discuss)
- Give my perspective on where the lab is going, where the field is going, and tips about surviving and thriving in academia
- Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, promoting your work at talks, writing recommendation letters for you, and letting you attend conferences as often as finances permit
- Help you prepare for the next steps of your career, whether it’s a post-doc, a faculty job, or a job in industry
- Care for your emotional and physical well-being and prioritize that above all else.
