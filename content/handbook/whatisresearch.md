A research project is a set of activities and medium that describes a scientific finding or technology. There are four major components in a research project that you need to keep track of:

- **Ideas and notes**: This includes all the conceptual aspect of your project, including project plans, meeting discussions, periodical experimental summaries. Use these to build the overall narrative of your story. 
- **Experiments**: This is your lab notebook, which consists of a series of experiments each containing (i) a detailed protocol, (ii) results, and (iii) analysis
- **Deliverables**: This includes things like manuscripts, talks, posters, patent applications that are generated during the course of the project.
- **Meta-data**: This includes all the project management tools you use to keep the project organized, such as inventory, to-do lists, and schedules.
