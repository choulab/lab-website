## Lab calendar access

The lab uses a Google Calendar to organize all group activities, such as group meetings, socials, lab clean ups, and institutional events. Send a request to this [email](lytchoulab@gmail.com) to obtain access. This will keep you in the loop on all lab activities. You are also expected to note any time you're away during [group hours](/handbook/hours#grouphours) on this calendar.

## Google Keep

Use this to generate daily to-do lists. You should develop the habit of doing this every day, right before you leave the lab (i.e. plan out your activities for the next day). Then, when you come in the next day, execute this list, checking items off as you go along. This will help you prioritize and stay focused.

## Remote journal access

You should be able to access journal articles off-campus by setting up virtual private network (VPN) on your computer. To do so, go to [UTORVpn](http://vpn.utoronto.ca/) and choose the right install for your computer (e.g. PC vs. Mac). Once installed, you will be able to access the UofT network via VPN. This should provide you with journal access directly from your browser as if youâ€™re on campus.

## File management

All materials generated from your project (including protocols, images, numerical data, scripts for analysis, presentation slides, manuscripts, ...etc.) should be kept in a centralized location so they can be accessed by current and future lab members. This location will be equipped with back up and version control. We are temporarily using [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/h) because it is easy to use. This location will also contain general lab files, such as the `Master Inventory` spreadsheet that we use to keep track of all inventories.

## Evernote

We use [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) to document all *conceptual* aspects of a project including the following items:

- **Meeting notes**: this includes both group and project meetings, and informal discussions with colleagues and advisors
- **Literature notes**: used to annotate papers that you read and find relevant
- **Presentation notes**: this includes notes you take at conference presentations
- **Ideas**: any time you have an idea, for example that stemmed from your research activities, such as follow up projects, new research questions, or ideas on how to solve a bottleneck, write them down so you can articulate them and discuss with Leo or other people later!

You should have **one notebook per project**. YOu should also create a `tag` for each of the items listed above. Everytime you jot down something, categorize them by tag. This will help you find the note later on (what good is a notebook if you can't ever find anything?). Get into the habit of writing down something every week, or even every day. Share your project notebook with all project members (including Leo!)

> Get into the habit of documenting all of your thoughts on paper! **Remember, the only thing between messing things around and science is writing things down!**
