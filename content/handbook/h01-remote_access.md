## Journal access

You should be able to access journal articles off-campus by setting up virtual private network (VPN) on your computer. To do so, go to [UTORVpn](http://vpn.utoronto.ca/) and choose the right install for your computer (e.g. PC vs. Mac). Once you’ve set this up, you will be able to access the UofT network via VPN. This should provide you with journal access directly from your browser as if you’re on campus.
