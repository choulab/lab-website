## Big picture

Science is hard. But it should also be fun. In the Chou lab, we want to ensure that everyone experiences an engaging, challenging, but rewarding lab environment. This is every one’s responsibility and common goal. To maintain this environment, we all have to do a few things:

- **Stoke fire into your passion**. Work hard on it and be proud of it. Be so proud that you have to suppress bragging (but it’s okay to brag sometimes).
- **Integrity.** We all make mistakes. We are not defined by our mistakes, but rather by how we deal with them. We don’t cover our mistakes. We admit them, make corrections, and move on. We also inform everyone involved, including your colleagues, your collaborators, and your supervisor. If someone else makes a mistake, we don’t shame. We encourage honesty through peer-to-peer support.
- **Rigor.** We all want to publish paper and do great things. But we do this honestly. It is never okay to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or fudge results in any way. Science is about finding the truth, and null results and unexpected results are still important. In this lab, we discuss these findings just as much as positive results.
- **Teamwork.** Support your fellow lab mates. Help them out if they need help. If you’ve received help, give someone credit. Acknowledge them publicly. Reciprocate. Good science is collaborative, not competitive. 
- **Citizenship.** Give constructive feedback and be happy to receive them. If you have a problem with Leo, let him know about it. If you have problems with lab mates but don’t feel comfortable confronting, let Leo know about it. Have each other’s back.
- **Health and happiness.** This is top priority. If you’re struggling, voice it to someone (feel free to tell Leo). Never be afraid to ask questions. If you see someone else struggling, escalate your concerns to Leo. We want everyone to be happy and having fun. 
- **Work-life balance.** Related to previous point. Science is a marathon, not a sprint. Have a life outside of the lab will keep you happy, energized, and overall more productive.

## Small picture

- **Punctuality.** Show up on time to meetings, classes, and the lab. Constantly improve your time management skills. Stay organized. Respect that everyone has a busy schedule and having access to their time is a privilege and their gift to you.
- **Self-motivation.** You’re not expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night. You are expected to get your work done (whatever time of the day you like to do it).
- If you’re sick, stay home and take care of yourself. Because you need it, and because others don’t need to get sick. If you’re sick, it is your responsibility to reschedule meetings and notify others involved as soon as you can.
- **Be present.** Show up to your meetings, classes, and the lab energized and engaged. It is unfair and disrespectful to your colleagues if you’re physically and mentally absent. If you’re struggling, escalate this to Leo or others to fix your concerns.
- **Maintenance.** Clean up after yourself. Keep things organized. Close the door on your way out. Be a vigilant and active citizen of the lab.
