Welcome to the Chou Lab at the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering within the University of Toronto. Our lab takes pride in our scientific rigor, our creativity, and our commitment to foster an inclusive and engaging environment. We invest in students and on mentoring them to realize their maximum potential. Now that you’ve made it to the lab, I want you to commit to being part of a tradition of excellence and be proud of this fact as we embark on this scientific journey together.

This is a “living” document. It is a record of our current best practices. As a group, we never stop to improve the way we work and learn together.  If you have ideas about things to add, clarify, or remove, talk to me (Leo, the PI) and we will make amendments to the document.

Everyone joining the lab is expected to read this manual and sign a form indicating that you have done so. By signing the form, you are committing to a set of mutually agreed upon conducts and responsibilities, as well as rights and resources that you’re entitled to as members of the lab.
