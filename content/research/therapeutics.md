Nature is the ultimate nanotechnologist. Every cell in the body is powered by molecular machines—proteins, RNA, and DNA—that self-assemble to carry out life’s most intricate functions.

We are a team of engineers, chemists, and immunologists working to build a new generation of nanotechnologies inspired by these natural systems. Our goal is not simply to mimic nature, but to harness and program it, developing scalable, self-assembling tools to solve real-world biomedical problems.
